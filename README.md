# KNN Classification & Regression Analysis

A machine learning project analyzing the No-Show Appointments dataset from Kaggle using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms to predict patient appointment attendance.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project uses the "No Show Appointments" dataset to build and evaluate KNN models for predicting whether patients will miss their scheduled medical appointments. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/soipanhamisi/KNN_Classification_Regression_Analysis.git
   cd KNN_Classification_Regression_Analysis
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the analysis**
   - Open `notebooks/assignment_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or your IDE
   - Run cells sequentially
   - The dataset will be automatically downloaded from Kaggle on first run

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Source:** [No Show Appointments Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

The dataset contains medical appointment records with patient demographics, appointment details, and no-show outcomes.
